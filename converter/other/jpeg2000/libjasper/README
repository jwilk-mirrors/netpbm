The code in the directory 'libjasper' is taken from the Jasper package.
In particular, from the 'src/libjasper' directory of Jasper Version
1.600.0.

The adaptation was done by Bryan Henderson on 2002.10.26.

The adaptation involved:

  - Remove stuff for formats other than JPEG-2000.

  - Replace build stuff (Jasper uses GNU Autoconf/Automake/Libtool).

  - Make JP2 decoder not dump the box to stderr unless debug is turned on.

You cannot build this library without a 64 bit compiler (and 64 bit
types such as int64_t defined).  It does a lot of 64 bit arithmetic.
