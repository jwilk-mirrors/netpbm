<h2>NAME</h2>
<b>ppmcolors</b> - obsolete

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><b>ppmcolors</b> is obsolete.  The more general program <b><a
href="pamseq.html">pamseq</a></b> took its place in June 2002.

<b>ppmcolors</b> remains for backward compatibility, but all it does
is run <b>pamseq</b>.  It is slower and less flexible than running
<b>pamseq</b> directly.
