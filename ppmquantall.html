<H2>NAME</H2>

<B>ppmquantall</B> - replaced by pnmquantall


<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>ppmquantall</b> was obsoleted by <a
href="pnmquantall.html"><b>pnmquantall</b></a>, introduced with Netpbm 10.58
(March 2012).  <b>pnmquantall</b> is just a renaming to reflect the fact
that the program handles all kinds of Netpbm input files, not just
PPM.  Though this was not always the case, it had been for many years
before the renaming.

<p>For Netpbm before 10.58, where the program is still named
<b>ppmquantall</b>, just use the <b>pnmquantall</b> manual.
