<H2>NAME</H2>
pamsharpness - measure the sharpness of a PNM/PAM image

<H2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</H2>

<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamsharpness</b> reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and prints a
message to Standard Output giving a number that tells how sharp it is.

<p>Sharpness is a measure of how suddenly (in space) colors change in
the image.  <b>pamsharpness</b> computes the sharpness of the image as
the average difference in intensity between each pixel and its 8 surrounding
pixels, in each of the color components (R, G, B).

<p><b>pamsharpness</b> does not include the edges of the image, where
there are not 8 pixels surrounding a pixel, in its computation.

<p><b>pamsharpness</b> assumes that the image is a PNM or PNM
equivalent PAM.  If it isn't, the results are not necessarily
meaningful.
