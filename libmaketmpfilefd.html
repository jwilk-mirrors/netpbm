<h2>NAME</h2>

pm_make_tmpfile_fd() - create a temporary named file

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre>
#include &lt;netpbm/pm.h&gt;

pm_make_tmpfile(int *         fdP,
                const char ** filenameP);
</pre>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<p>This simple example creates a temporary file, writes "hello
world" to it, then writes some search patterns to it, then uses
it as input to <b>grep</b>:

<pre>
#include &lt;netpbm/pm.h&gt;

int fd;
const char * myfilename;

pm_make_tmpfile_fd(&amp;fdP, &amp;myfilename);

write(fd, "^account:\\s.*\n", 16);
fprintf(fd, "^name:\\s.*\n", 13);

close(fd);

asprintfN(&amp;grepCommand, "grep --file='%s' /tmp/infile &gt;/tmp/outfile");

system(grepCommand);

strfree(grepCommand);

unlink(myfilename);

strfree(myfilename);

</pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This library function is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pm_make_tmpfile_fd()</b> is analogous to <a
href="libmaketmpfile.html"><b>pm_make_tmpfile()</b></a>.  The only
difference is that it opens the file as a low level file, as
<b>open()</b> would, rather than as a stream, as <b>fopen()</b> would.

<p>If you don't need to access the file by name, use
<b>pm_tmpfile_fd()</b> instead, because it's cleaner.  With
<b>pm_tmpfile_fd()</b>, the operating system always deletes the
temporary file when your program exits, if the program failed to clean
up after itself.


<h2>HISTORY</h2>

<p><b>pm_tmpfile()</b> was introduced in Netpbm 10.42 (March 2008).
