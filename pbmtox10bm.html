<H2>NAME</H2>
pbmtox10bm - convert a PBM image to an X11 bitmap

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<p><b>pbmtox10bm</b> was replaced in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006) by
<b><a href="pbmtoxbm.html">pbmtoxbm</a></b>.

<P><B>pbmtoxbm</b> with the <b>-x10</b> option is backward compatible
with <b>pbmtox10bm</b>.  <b>pbmtoxbm</b> also can generate X11 bitmaps.

<P>You should not make any new use of <b>pbmtox10bm</b> and if you modify an
existing use, you should upgrade to <b>pbmtoxbm</b>.  But note that if you
write a program that might have to be used with old Netpbm, <b>pbmtox10bm</b>
is the only way to do that.
