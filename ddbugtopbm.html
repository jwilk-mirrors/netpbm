<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>ddbugtopbm</b> converts all sketches present in a database used
by the PalmOS programs <b>Diddle</b> or <b>DiddleBug</b> into
appropriately-named PBM files.  The backup copy of DiddleBug's
database you should use as this program's input is usually called
<B>DiddleBugDB.pdb</b>.  Or if you use the original Diddle, it has two
separate DBs - <B>DiddleDB.pdb</B>, containing unnamed `scratch'
sketches, and <B>DiddleIDB.pdb</B>, containing the saved (and named)
sketches which are listed by its `index' option.  You can feed this
program any of these three on standard input.

<H2 id="using">USING THE PROGRAM</H2>

<p>I recommend you <em>not</em> run <b>ddbugtopbm</b> from your Palm
backup directory, i.e. don't run it from the directory the DB will
normally be in.  Instead, run it from some other directory (perhaps you
could make a directory purely to hold the PBM files, just to keep
things simple) and use an absolute or relative path to the DB.

<p>The filenames used for the output PBMs are based on the names given
to each sketch; if you have an unnamed sketch, it's given a name along
the lines of <B>sketch-0123.pbm</b>.

<p>While the named sketches will overwrite any existing PBM file with
the same name, the unnamed ones won't - they'll just try using another
filename.  (I think this is probably the right approach, as you can't
really tell the unnamed sketches apart.)



<H2 id="limitations">LIMITATIONS</H2>

<p>The DiddleBug DB reader is only known to work with DBs from
DiddleBug version 2.50. But it should probably work on later versions,
and I think it'll work on DBs from version 2.15 as well.

<P>It might fall over if fed an empty database, and doesn't do much
(if any) checking of the input.
