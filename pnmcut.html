<B>pnmcut</B> - replaced by pamcut


<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pnmcut</b> was obsoleted by <a
href="pamcut.html"><b>pamcut</b></a>, introduced with Netpbm 9.20 (May
2001).  <b>pamcut</b> is backward compatible with <b>pnmcut</b>, plus
adds many additional functions, including the ability to process PAM
images.

<p><b>pnmcut</b> remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.46 (March
2009) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than <b>pamcut</b> due to its
age.  But now it would just be clutter.
