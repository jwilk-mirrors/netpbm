<h1>pnmscale</h1>
Updated: 02 February 2009

<h2>NAME</h2>

pnmscale - replaced by pamscale

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pnmscale</b> was obsoleted by <a
href="pamscale.html"><b>pamscale</b></a>, introduced with Netpbm 10.20
(January 2004).  <b>pamscale</b> is backward compatible with <b>pnmscale</b>,
plus adds many additional functions, including the ability to process PAM
images.

<p><b>pnmscale</b> remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.46 (March
2009) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than <b>pamscale</b> because of
its age.  But now it would just be clutter.

<p>In Netpbm before 10.20, use the manual for <b>pamscale</b> with
<b>pnmscale</b>.  Features that are in <b>pamscale</b> but not <b>pnmscale</b>
are indicated by statements that they didn't exist before 10.20.
