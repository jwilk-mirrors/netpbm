pnm - Netpbm superformat

<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>The PNM format is just an abstraction of the PBM, PGM, and PPM
formats.  I.e. the name &quot;PNM&quot; refers collectively to
PBM, PGM, and PPM.

<P>The name &quot;PNM&quot; is an acronym derived from &quot;Portable
Any Map.&quot; This derivation makes more sense if you consider
it in the context of the other Netpbm format names: PBM, PGM, and PPM.

<P>The more general term &quot;Netpbm format&quot; refers to the PNM
formats plus PAM.

<p>PNM is principally used with <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<P>Note that besides being names of formats, PBM, PGM, PPM, and PNM
are also classes of programs.  A PNM program can take PBM, PGM, or PPM
input.  That's nothing special -- a PPM program can too.  But a PNM
program can often produce multiple output formats as well, and a PNM
program can see the difference between PBM, PGM, and PPM input and
respond to each differently whereas a PPM program sees everything as
if it were PPM.  This is discussed more in <a href="index.html">the
description of the netpbm programs</a>.

<P>&quot;pnm&quot; also appears in the names of the most general <a
href="libnetpbm.html">Netpbm library routines</a>, some of which aren't even
related to the PNM format.
