<h2>NAME</h2>

pamoil - turn a PAM image into an oil painting

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>pamoil</b>

[<b>-n</b> <i>N</i>]

[<i>pamfile</i>]

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamoil</b> reads a Netpbm image as input and does an "oil
transfer", and writes the same type of Netpbm image as output.

<p>The oil transfer is described in "Beyond Photography" by
Holzmann, chapter 4, photo 7.  It's a sort of localized smearing.

<p>The smearing works like this: First, assume a grayscale image.  For
each pixel in the image, <b>pamoil</b> looks at a square neighborhood
around it.  <b>pamoil</b> determines what is the most common pixel
intensity in the neighborhood, and puts a pixel of that intensity into
the output in the same position as the input pixel.

<p>For color images, or any arbitrary multi-channel image,
<b>pamoil</b> computes each channel (e.g. red, green, and blue)
separately the same way as the grayscale case above.

<p>At the edges of the image, where the regular neighborhood would run
off the edge of the image, <b>pamoil</b> uses a clipped neighborhood.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>pamoil</b> recognizes the following
command line option:

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-n</b> <i>size</i>

<dd>This is the size of the neighborhood used in the smearing.  The
neighborhood is this many pixels in all four directions.

<p>The default is 3.
