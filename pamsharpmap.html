<h2>NAME</h2>
pamsharpmap - create map of sharpness in a PNM/PAM image

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<b>pamsharpmap</b> [<i>imagefile</i>]

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamsharpmap</b> reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and produces
an image that shows how sharp it is at each location.

<p>Sharpness is a measure of how suddenly (in space) colors change in
the image.  <b>pamsharpmap</b> computes the sharpness of each
component color (R, G, B) separately and produces a pixel whose
intensity of each component color is directly proportional to the
sharpness of that component color at the same location in the input
image.  Thus, at a point where the image is very sharp in its red and
green components, but dull in its blue component, you will see a
yellow pixel in the output.

<p><b>pamsharpmap</b> computes sharpness at a point simply as the
average difference in intensity between the pixel at that point and
the 8 pixels surrounding it.

<p>At the edges of the image, where there are not 8 pixels surrounding
a pixel, <b>pamsharpmap</b> assumes the image is extended with a black
border.

<p><b>pamsharpmap</b> assumes that the image is a PNM or PNM
equivalent PAM.  If it isn't, the results are not necessarily
meaningful.

<p>The output image is the same dimensions, depth, and tuple type as
the input, and has maxval 255.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>There are no command line options defined specifically
for <b>pamsharpmap</b>, but it recognizes the options common to all
programs based on libnetpbm (See <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>.)

<h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>

<p><b>pamsharpmap</b> was added to Netpbm in Release 10.21 (March
2004).  Bryan Henderson derived it from the program <b>pnmsharp</b> by
B.W. van Schooten and distributed as part of the Photopnmtools
package.
