<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<P><B>pnmremap</B> replaces the colors in an input image with those
from a palette you specify.  Where colors in the input are present in
the palette, they just stay the same in the output.  But where the
input contains a color that is not in the palette, <b>pnmremap</b>
gives you these choices:
<ul>

<li>Choose the closest color from the palette.

<li>Choose the first color from the palette.

<li>Use a color specified by a command option (<b>-missing</b>).

<li>Dither.  This means rather than mapping pixel by pixel,
<b>pnmremap</b> uses colors from the palette to try to make
multi-pixel regions of the output have the same average color as the
input (for another kind of dithering, see <b>ppmdither</b>).

</ul>

<P>Two reasons to use this program are: 1) you want to reduce the
number of colors in the input image; and 2) you need to feed the image
to something that can handle only certain colors.

<P>To reduce colors, you can generate the palette with
<B>pnmcolormap</B>.

<p>By default, <b>pnmremap</b> maps an input color that is not in the
palette to the closest color that <em>is</em> in the palette.  Closest
means with the smallest Cartesian distance in the red, green, blue
brightness space (smallest sum of the squares of the differences in
red, green, and blue ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 gamma-adjusted
intensities).

<p>You can instead specify a single default color for <b>pnmremap</b>
to use for any color in the input image that is not in the palette.
Use the <b>-missing</b> option for this.

<p>You can also specify that the first color in the palette image
is the default.  Use the <b>-firstisdefault</b> option for this.

<p>The palette is simply a PNM image.  The colors of the pixels in the
image are the colors in the palette.  Where the pixels appear in the
image, and the dimensions of the image, are irrelevant.  Multiple
pixels of the same color are fine.  However, a palette image is
typically a single row with one pixel per color.

<p>If you specify <b>-missing</b>, the color you so specify is in
the palette in addition to whatever is in the palette image.

<p>For historical reasons, Netpbm sometimes calls the palette a
"colormap." But it doesn't really map anything.
<b>pnmremap</b> creates its own map, based on the palette, to map
colors from the input image to output colors.

<h3 id="mismatch">Palette/Image Type Mismatch</h3>

<p>In the simple case, the palette image is of the same depth (number
of planes, i.e. number of components in each tuple (pixel)) as the
input image and <b>pnmremap</b> just does a straightforward search of
the palette for each input tuple (pixel).  In fact, <b>pnmremap</b>
doesn't even care if the image is a visual image.

<p>But what about when the depths differ?  In that case,
<b>pnmremap</b> converts the input image (in its own memory) to match
the palette and then proceeds as above.

<p>There are only two such cases in which <b>pnmremap</b> knows how to
do the conversion:  when one of them is tuple type RGB, depth 3, and the
other is tuple type GRAYSCALE or BLACKANDWHITE, depth 1; and vice
versa.

<p>In any other case, <b>pnmremap</b> issues and error message and fails.

<p>Note that as long as your input and palette images are PNM, they'll
always fall into one of the cases <b>pnmremap</b> can handle.  There's an
issue only if you're using some exotic PAM image.

<p>Before Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005), <b>pnmremap</b> could not handle
the case of a palette of greater depth than the input image.  (It would
issue an error message and fail in that case).  You can use <b>ppmtoppm</b>
to increase the depth of the input image to work around this limitation.

<p>In any case, the output image has the same tuple type and depth as
the palette image.

<h3 id="multiple">Multiple Image Stream</h3>

<p><b>pnmremap</b> handles a multiple image input stream, producing a
multiple image output stream.  The input images need not be similar in
any way.

<p>Before Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005), <b>pnmremap</b> ignored any image
after the first.


<h3 id="example">Examples</h3>

<pre>
pnmcolormap testimg.ppm 256 &gt;palette.ppm

pnmremap -map=palette.ppm testimg.ppm &gt;reduced_testimg.ppm
</pre>

<P>To limit colors to a certain set, a typical example is to create an
image for posting on the World Wide Web, where different browsers know
different colors.  But all browsers are supposed to know the 216
"web safe" colors which are essentially all the colors you
can represent in a PPM image with a maxval of 5.  So you can do this:

<PRE>
pamseq 3 5 &gt;websafe.pam

pnmremap -map=websafe.pam testimg.ppm &gt;websafe_testimg.ppm
</PRE>

<p>Another useful palette is one for the 8 color IBM TTL color set, which
you can create with
<pre>
pamseq 3 1 &gt;ibmttl.pam
</pre>

<p>If you want to quantize one image to use the colors in another one,
just use the second one as the palette.  You don't have to reduce it
down to only one pixel of each color, just use it as is.

<P>The output image has the same type and maxval as the palette image.

<H2 id="parameters">PARAMETERS</H2>

<P>There is one parameter, which is required: The file specification of
the input PNM file.


<H2 id="options">OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>-mapfile=</B><i>palettefilename</i>
<DD>
This names the file that contains the palette image.

<P>This option is mandatory.

<DT><B>-floyd</B>
<DT><B>-fs</B>
<DT><B>-nofloyd</B>
<DT><B>-nofs</B>

<DD>
These options determine whether <b>pnmremap</b> does Floyd-Steinberg
dithering.  Without Floyd-Steinberg, <b>pnmremap</b> selects the output color
of a pixel based on the color of only the corresponding input pixel.  With
Floyd-Steinberg, <b>pnmremap</b> considers regions of pixels such that the
average color of a region is the same in the output as in the input.  The
dithering effect appears as a dot pattern up close, but from a distance, the
dots blend so that you see more colors than are present in the color map.

<p>As an example, if your color map contains only black and white, and
the input image has 4 adjacent pixels of gray, <b>pnmremap</b> with
Floyd-Steinberg would generate output pixels black, white, black, white,
which from a distance looks gray.  But without Floyd-Steinberg,
<b>pnmremap</b> would generate 4 white pixels, white being the single-pixel
approximation of gray.

<p>Floyd-Steinberg gives vastly better results on images where
unmodified quantization has banding or other artifacts, especially
when going to a small number of colors such as the above IBM set.
However, it does take substantially more CPU time.
     
<P><B>-fs</B> is a synonym for <B>-floyd</B>.  <B>-nofs</B> is a
synonym for <B>-nofloyd</B>.

<P>The default is <B>-nofloyd</B>.

<p>Before Netpbm 10.46 (March 2009), dithering doesn't work quite as you
expect if the color map has a lower maxval than the input.  <b>pnmremap</b>
reduces the color resolution to the color map's maxval before doing any
dithering, so the dithering does not have the effect of making the image,
at a distance, appear to have the original maxval.  In current Netpbm, it
does.

<dt><b>-norandom</b>

<dd>This option affects a detail of the Floyd-Steinberg dithering process.
It has no effect if you aren't doing Floyd-Steinberg dithering.

<p>By default, <b>pnmremap</b> initializes the error propagation
accumulator to random values to avoid the appearance of unwanted
patterns.  This is an extension of the original Floyd-Steinberg
algorithm.

<p>A drawback of this is that the same <b>pnmremap</b> on the same
input produces slightly different output every time, which makes
comparison difficult.

<p>With <b>-norandom</b>, <b>pnmremap</b> initializes the error
accumulators to zero and the output is completely predictable.

<p>Alternatively, you can use <b>-randomseed</b> to get randomization
across the image, but still have repeatable results.

<p>You cannot specify this along with <b>-randomseed</b>.
  
<p><b>-norandom</b> was new in Netpbm 10.39 (June 2007).


<dt><b>-randomseed=</b><i>n</i>

<dd>This option affects a detail of the Floyd-Steinberg dithering process.
It has no effect if you aren't doing Floyd-Steinberg dithering.

<p>This option supplies the seed for the random number generator used in the
randomization process described in the explanation of the <b>-norandom</b>
option.  If you run <b>pnmremap</b> twice with the same <b>-randomseed</b>
value, you will get identical results.

<p>If you do not specify <b>-randomseed</b>, <b>pnmremap</b> chooses a seed
at random, adding another level of randomness to the dithering.

<p>You cannot specify this along with <b>-norandom</b>.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.82 (March 2018).
  

<DT><B>-firstisdefault</B>

<DD>This tells <b>pnmremap</b> to map any input color that is not in
the palette to the first color in the palette (the color of the pixel
in the top left corner of the palette image)

<p>See <a href="#description">DESCRIPTION</a>.

<P>If you specify <B>-firstisdefault</B>, the maxval of your input
must match the maxval of your palette image.

<DT><B>-missingcolor=</B><I>colorspec</I>

<DD>This specifies the default color for <b>pnmremap</b> to map to a
color in the input image that isn't in the palette.  <I>color</I> may
or may not be in the palette image; it is part of the palette
regardless.

<P><i>colorspec</i> is as described for
the <a href="libnetpbm_image.html#colorname">argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b>
library routine</a>.

<P>If you specify <B>-missingcolor</B>, the maxval of your input must
match the maxval of your palette image.

<DT><B>-verbose</B>

<DD>Display helpful messages about the mapping process.

<H2 id="history">HISTORY</H2>

<p><b>pnmremap</b> first appeared in Netpbm 9.23 (January 2002).
Before that, its function was available only as part of the function
of <b>pnmquant</b> (which was derived from the much older
<b>ppmquant</b>).  Color quantization really has two main subfunctions, so
Netpbm 9.23 split it out into two separate programs:
<b>pnmcolormap</b> and <b>pnmremap</b> and then Netpbm 9.24 replaced
<b>pnmquant</b> with a program that simply calls <b>pnmcolormap</b> and
<b>pnmremap</b>.
