<?makeman .SH DESCRIPTION ?>

<p>This reference manual covers functions in the <b>libnetpbm</b> library for
accessing fonts to draw text characters, using the PBM image format and the
<b>libnetpbm</b> in-memory image formats.

<p>We actually have very little information here; this is mainly a
framework for adding documentation later if someone becomes interested
in this facility.

<p>Note that the primary known user of this library is the Netpbm program
<b>pbmtext</b>.  You can use that program's source code as an example.


<h2 id="fontobject">Font Object</h2>

<p><b>libnetpbm</b> represents a font with an object of type
<b>struct font</b>.  The library provides functions to create these objects.
  
<P>The object these functions create is in newly allocated memory and you
can't actually free it.  The memory may be in multiple pieces, pointing to
each other, and <b>libnetpbm</b> provides no destroy function.  (This is only
because of implementation laziness).


<h2 id="thefunctions">The Functions</h2>

<p>The functions are all declared in the <b>pbmfont.h</b> header file.

<h3 id="pbm_defaultfont"><b>pbm_defaultfont</b></h3>

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<pre>
<code>
    struct font *
    pbm_defaultfont(const char * which);
</code>
</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This returns a font object representing a font built in to <b>libnetpbm</b>.

<p><i>which</i> is the name of the desired built-in font.  There are two:
<dl>
  <dt>bdf
    <dd>A proportional font similar to Adobe's <b>timR12</b> font
  <dt>fixed
    <dd>A fixed space font
</dl>

<h4>Copyright</h4>

<p>The provenance of the built-in fonts are not known for sure, but in 2018,
the <b>bdf</b> font was almost identical to a font on which Adobe and
Digital Equipment Corporation once claimed copyright.  That font was
available in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/current/src/font/">X.org source code</a> in a
collection named &quot;font-adobe-75dpi&quot;, in a file named
<b>timR12.pcf.gz</b>.

<P>Ergo, it is likely that the font was copied into Netpbm from that font in
1991.

<p>You may need a copyright license from the copyright owners of that original
font not only to copy the <b>libnetpbm</b> code, but to execute it, thus
generating copies of the glyphs of the font.
  
<p>The X.org files in 2018 indicate the following copyright claims, along
with a license to the public to copy them:
<blockquote>
<p>
  Copyright 1984-1989, 1994 Adobe Systems Incorporated.
  Copyright 1988, 1994 Digital Equipment Corporation.

  notice appear in supporting documentation, and that the names of

  without specific, written prior permission.  Adobe Systems and

<h3 id="pbm_dissectfont"><b>pbm_dissectfont</b></h3>

<h3 id="pbm_loadfont"><b>pbm_loadfont</b></h3>

<p>This function returns a font object for a font described in a file.  The
file may be either a special PBM file or a BDF file.  The function determines
which it is and behaves as either <b>pbm_loadpbmfont</b>
or <b>pbm_loadbdffont</b> accordingly.

<h3 id="pbm_loadpbmfont"><b>pbm_loadpbmfont</b></h3>

<h3 id="pbm_loadbffont2"><b>pbm_loadbdffont2</b></h3>

<h3 id="pbm_loadbdffont"><b>pbm_loadbdffont</b></h3>

<p>This is obsolete.  New programs should use <b>pbm_loadbdffont2</b>
instead.
  
<h3 id="pbm_expandbdffont"><b>pbm_expandbdffont</b></h3>

<h3 id="pbm_dumpfont"><b>pbm_dumpfont</b></h3>
