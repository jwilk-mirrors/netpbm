[<i>pgmfile</i>]

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p>This program is almost entirely obsolete since Netpbm 10.23 (July
2004).  Use <a href="pamditherbw.html"><b>pamditherbw</b></a> to do
what this program used to do.

<p><b>pgmtopbm</b> never was the simple converter it appeared to be.
It was a dithering program.  Unfortunately, it didn't do the dithering
properly because it treated the PGM input samples as if they were
directly proportional to light intensity, but they are actually
gamma-adjusted.

<p><b>pamditherbw</b> is backward compatible with <b>pgmtopbm</b>
except that it 
<ul>
<li>does the correct gamma adjustments.
<li>produces PAM output instead of PBM.  (Modern Netpbm programs that
accept PBM input also accept PAM input, but if you need actual PBM,
you can use <b>pamtopnm</b> with <b>pamditherbw</b>).
</ul>
So use the manual for <b>pamditherbw</b> for <b>pgmtopbm</b>, except
ignore anything that says it was added after Netpbm Release 10.23
and ignore any options that are not shown in the synopsis above.

<p>Although <b>pgmtopbm</b> is mostly obsolete, the simple threshold
method (specified by <b>-threshold</b>) is an exception.  Unlike the
other conversion methods, gamma-adjustment is not an issue with
simple thresholding and <b>pgmtopbm</b> can produce PBM output
directly.  Note that even in this basic mode of operation
<b>pgmtopbm</b> may produce output which is slightly different from
what <b>pamditherbw</b> does because of differences in internal
calculation.

<p>If you just want to convert a PGM image with maxval 1 to PBM,
use <a href="pamtopnm.html"><b>pamtopnm</b></a>.
