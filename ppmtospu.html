<h2>NAME</h2>
ppmtospu - convert a PPM image to an Atari Spectrum 512 image

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>ppmtospu</b>

[<b>-d0</b>|<b>-d2</b>|<b>-d4</b>]
[<i>ppmfile</i>]

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
You may use two hyphens instead of one.  You may separate an option
name and its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>. 

<p>This program converts from the PPM format to the uncompressed Spectrum 512
image format used on Atari ST computers.

<p>Input comes from the file you name with the <i>ppmfile</i> argument, or
Standard Input by default.  Output goes to Standard Output.

<p>The input must be 320 pixels wide by 200 pixels high.  If you have an
image of a different size, you can use <b>pamcut</b> or <b>pamscale</b>
to force it to these dimensions.


<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>ppmtospu</b> recognizes the following
command line options:

<dl>
<dt><b>-d0</b>
<dd>The program does no dithering.

<dt><b>-d2</b>
<dd>The program uses a 2x2 ordered dither.
<p>This is the default.

<dt><b>-d4</b>
<dd>The program uses a 4x4 ordered dither.
    
</dl>

<h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>

<p>This program was new in Netpbm 10.58 (March 2012).

<p>But it was written in 1990.  Steve Belczyk posted it along
with <b>sputoppm</b>, <b>spctoppm</b>, <b>pi1toppm</b>, and
<b>pi1toppm</b> - all programs for dealing with Atari image formats -
to comp.sources.misc on July 15, 1990.  For reasons that have been lost
to history, all of these entered the Netpbm (then Pbmplus) distribution
<em>except</em> <b>ppmtospu</b>.

<p>Georges Kesseler wondered In March 2012 why there was no counterpart to
<b>sputoppm</b> in Netpbm and searched the web, finding only one reference
to <b>ppmtopsu</b>: the 1990 comp.sources.misc posting, including the source
code.  He emailed the Netpbm maintainer suggesting it be added.

<p>Bryan Henderson found the source code to be extremely primitive, not even
using common library code.  So Bryan completely recoded it, but retained
nearly all of the original logic.
