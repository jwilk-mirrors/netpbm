<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>ppmtoascii</b> reads a PPM image as input and produces a somewhat
crude ASCII graphic image as output, with ANSI terminal control characters
so it has crude color when sent to a color text terminal.

<P>There is no converter for the other direction.

<p><b>ppmtoterm</b> does a similar thing, but displays each character of the
image as a single pixel (using the same dense character for every pixel),
whereas <b>ppmtoascii</b> combines 2 or 8 pixels into one character, where
the character roughly represents those particular pixels.

<p>Note that ANSI provides for only eight colors (including black and white).

<p>Note that an ANSI terminal can't display a single character in multiple
colors, so where a character represents 8 pixels of differing colors, the
color of the character is one that is the average of the colors of those
pixels.

<p><b>pbmtoascii</b> does the same thing for PBM images, with no terminal
control characters (because none are needed for a strictly black and white
image).


<H2 id="options">OPTIONS</H2>

<p>The <B>-1x2</B> and <B>-2x4</B> options give you two alternate ways for the
pixels to get mapped to characters.  With <B>1x2</B>, the default, each
character represents a group of 1 pixel across by 2 pixels down.  With
<B>-2x4</B>, each character represents 2 pixels across by 4 pixels down.
