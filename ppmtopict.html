ppmtopict - convert a PPM image to a Macintosh PICT file

<H2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</H2>

[<I>ppmfile</I>]

<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>ppmtopict</b> reads a PPM image as input and produces a
Macintosh PICT file as output.

<P>The generated file is only the data fork of a picture.  You will
need a program such as <I>mcvert</I> to generate a Macbinary or a
BinHex file that contains the necessary information to identify the
file as a PICT file to MacOS.

<P>Even though PICT can have 2 and 4 bits per pixel, <b>ppmtopict</b>
always generates an 8 bits per pixel file.

<H2 id="limitations">LIMITATIONS</H2>

<p>The picture size field is correct only if the output is to a file
since writing into this field requires seeking backwards on a file.
However the PICT documentation seems to suggest that this field is not
critical anyway since it is only the lower 16 bits of the picture
size.
