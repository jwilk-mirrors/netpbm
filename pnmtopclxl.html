<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use white
space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from its value.


<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pnmtopclxl</b> reads one or more PNM input streams, each containing one
or more PNM images, and generates a sequence of output pages in the
HP PCL-XL (formerly named PCL 6) printer control language.  You can send
this stream to a PCL-XL printer to print the images.

<p>Alternatively, you can make <b>pnmtopclxl</b> generate just the PCL-XL
instructions to print an image, which you can embed in your own PCL-XL
stream to place an image on one of your pages.  (<b>-embedded</b> option).

<p>If the input is PPM, the output is a color printer stream (the PCL
color space is RGB).  Otherwise, the output is grayscale (the PCL color space
is grayscale).  If you want a grayscale output from a color input, run your
input through <b><a href="ppmtopgm.html">ppmtopgm</a></b>.  See the 
<b>-colorok</b> option for more information about choosing between color
and grayscale.

<p>The output goes to Standard Output.  All of the pages go to one
file, concatenated in the same order as the input images.


<H2 id="options">OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<dt><b>-dpi=</b><i>N</i>
<dd>This option selects the resolution of the image (not the printer!).
<i>N</i> is the resolution in dots per inch, from 1 to 65535.  The default
is 300.

<dt><b>-xoffs=</b><i>N</i>
<dd>This option and <b>-yoffs</b> determine the location on the page of the
upper left corner of each image.  Note that the image may have built in
borders too, which would make the main image within more left and down 
that what you specify here.

<p><b>-xoffs</b> and <b>-yoffs</b> specify the distance from the left of the
page and from the top of the page, respectively, in inches, of the upper left
corner of the image.  The default for each is zero.

<p>These options are meaningless if you specify <b>-center</b>.

<dt><b>-yoffs</b> <i>N</i>
<dd>See <b>-xoffs</b>.

<dt><b>-center</b>
<dd>This option tells <b>pnmtopclxl</b> to center each image on the page.
If you don't specify this option, the position of an image on the page is
determined by <b>-xoffs</b> and <b>-yoffs</b> (or their defaults).

<dt><b>-duplex=</b>{<b>vertical</b>|<b>horizontal</b>} <dd>This option
causes <b>pnmtopclxl</b> to create a printer stream that prints pages
on both sides of the sheet of paper.  <b>vertical</b> means to print
them so that the left edge of both pages is on the same edge of the
sheet, while <b>horizontal</b> means the more usual duplexing where the
top of both pages is on the same edge of the sheet.

<dt><b>-format=</b><i>paperformat</i>
<dd>This option selects the media (e.g. paper size) that the printer
control stream specifies.  <i>paperformat</i> is one of the following
self-explanatory keywords:

<ul>
<li>letter
<li>legal
<li>a3
<li>a4
<li>a5
<li>a6
<li>jb4
<li>jb5
<li>jb6
<li>exec
<li>ledger
<li>b5envelope
<li>c5envelope
<li>com10envelope
<li>monarchenvelope
<li>dlenvelope
<li>jpostcard
<li>jdoublepostcard
</ul>

<p>The default is <b>letter</b>.

<dt><b>-feeder=</b><i>N</i>
<dd>This options selects the media source (e.g. paper tray) that the
printer control stream specifies.

<dt><b>-copies=</b><i>N</i>
<dd>This option specifies the number of copies that the printer control
stream tells the printer to print.

<dt><b>-rendergray</b>

<dd>This option causes <b>pnmtopclxl</b> to include in the output
stream a command to set the RENDERMODE environment variable to
GRAYSCALE, which typically causes the printer to print in grayscale
regardless of the colors in the input, and may cause it to run much
faster even if the image is grayscale anyway.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.29 (August 2005).

<dt><b>-jobsetup=</b><i>filename</i>

<dd>This option causes <b>pnmtopclxl</b> to include arbitrary job setup
PJL commands at the beginning of the output stream.  It reads them from
the named file.

<p><b>pnmtopclxl</b> does not inspect these commands in any way, but it
does expect them to be job setup commands.  If you have garbage in your
file, you will hear from the printer.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.29 (August 2005).

<dt><b>-colorok</b>
<dd>This option simply tells <b>pnmtopclxl</b> not to warn you if you supply
a color input and therefore get color output.  By default, <b>pnmtopclxl</b>
issues a warning any time it produces a color printer stream because it is
usually a mistake.  It's a mistake because PCL XL is mainly used for laser
printers, and laser printers are mainly black and white.  If you send a color
print stream to a black and white printer, it typically refuses to print
anything, and even if it manages to convert it to black and white and print
it, it takes 3 times as long to transmit a color stream to the printer than
to transmit the grayscale image that gives the same result.

<dt><b>-embedded</b>
<dd>
Without this option, <b>pnmtopclxl</b> generates an entire printer control
stream that sets up the printer, ejects pages, and places a lone image on
each page.  With the option, <b>pnmtopclxl</b> generates only the instructions
to generate the image itself.  This is not useful all by itself, but you
can embed it in a suitable PCL-XL stream in order to add an image to it.

<p>This makes sense only for a single image, so you cannot specify multiple
input files and if an input file has multiple images in it, <b>pnmtopclxl</b>
ignores any after the first (it won't even read them).

<p>All the options that control the printer control stream outside the image
itself, such as <b>-xoffs</b> and <b>-feeder</b> are invalid
with <b>-embedded</b>.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.54 (March 2011).
