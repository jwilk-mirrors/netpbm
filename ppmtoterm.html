<h2>NAME</h2>

ppmtoterm - convert a PPM image to a ANSI ISO 6429 ascii image

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>ppmtoterm</b>

[<i>ppmfile</i>]

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
You may use two hyphens instead of one.  You may separate an option
name and its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>. 

<p>This program tries to produce an accurate representation of a PPM
image on an terminal that implements the ANSI ISO 6429 standard.  It
approximates colors, finding the minimum Cartesian distance between the
input RGB vectors and the ones in the generated palette.  As the
available color palette is somewhat restricted, you get the best
results when the colors in the original image are few and the RGB
intensities are close to zero, half of maximum, and maximum.

<p>You can usually get good results with cartoons or images with
plain colors (no gradients).  With photos, results can vary, but are
usually not very accurate.

<p>The output image has one line for each row and one character for each
column of the input image.  E.g. an 80 pixel by 25 pixel PPM image would
fill up an 80x25 terminal screen.  Use <b>pamscale</b> or <b>pamcut</b>
to make your image fit properly on your screen.

<p>Furthermore, use <b>pamscale</b> to recover the proper aspect ratio,
because a character on a terminal screen is rarely square.  Typically, a
character is twice has high as it is wide, so in order for a 20x20 image to
appear square on your terminal, as it should, you'll want to squash it
vertically or stretch it horizontally by a factor of two (resulting int 10x20
characters are 20x40 characters).

<p>The image starts at the current cursor position on the terminal
screen.  Each successive row starts at Column 0 on the screen.  If you want
to shift the image up or down, for example to center it, use
<b>pnmpad</b> on the input.

<p>This program was born with the objective of displaying nice color
images on the Linux console, e.g. a proper logo at Linux boot.

<p><b>ppmtoascii</b> does a similar things, but combines 2 or 8 pixels into
one character, where the character roughly represents those particular pixels,
whereas <b>ppmtoterm</b> displays each character of the image as a single
pixel.

<p><b>pbmto4425</b> does a similar thing for black and white images, using
line drawing characters, on some terminals.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>There are no command line options defined specifically
for <b>ppmtoterm</b>, but it recognizes the options common to all
programs based on libnetpbm (See <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>.)
