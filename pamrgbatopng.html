<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamrgbatopng</b> was obsoleted by <a
href="pamtopng.html"><b>pamtopng</b></a>, introduced with Netpbm 10.70
(June 2015).  <b>pamtopng</b> is backward compatible with
<b>pamrgbatopng</b>, plus adds a plethora additional functions.

<p>Starting in Release 10.70, <b>pamrgbatopng</b> is just an alias for
<b>pamtopng</b>.

<p><b>pamrgbatopng</b> was added to Netpbm in 2005, and was always expected to
be retired eventually because it had almost no features, compared to the more
popular and much older <b>pnmtopng</b>.  It had, in fact, no command line
options.  But the one feature it had that <b>pnmtopng</b> lacked was the
ability to recognize transparency in a PAM image.  <b>pamtopng</b> has that,
as well as most of the features of <b>pnmtopng</b>.
