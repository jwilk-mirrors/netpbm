[<I>iconfile</I>]


<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pbmtoicon</b> was obsoleted by <a
href="pbmtosunicon.html"><b>pbmtosunicon</b></a>, introduced with Netpbm 10.53
(December 2010).  <b>pbmtosunicon</b> is backward compatible with
<b>pbmtoicon</b>, plus adds additional functions, including the
ability to convert a Depth=8 Sun icon, producing a PGM image.

<p>Starting in Release 10.53, <b>pbmtoicon</b> is just an alias for
<b>pbmtosunicon</b>.

<p>The point of the name change is that there are many kinds of icons in the
world besides Sun icons, and in 2010, the Sun variety isn't even common.

<p>In releases before 10.53, you can use the <b>pbmtosunicon</b> documentation
for <b>pbmtoicon</b>, as long as you recognize that any change the
<b>pbmtosunicon</b> manual says happened in or after Netpbm 10.53 doesn't
apply to <b>pbmtoicon</b>.
