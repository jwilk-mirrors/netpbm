<h2>NAME</h2>
pbmreduce - read a PBM image and reduce it N times

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>pbmreduce</b>
[<b>-floyd</b>|<b>-fs</b>|<b>-threshold</b>]
[<b>-value</b> <i>val</i>] <i>N</i>
[<b>-randomseed=</b><i>integer</i>]
[<i>pbmfile</i>]

<p>You can abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix.

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pbmreduce</b> reads a PBM image as input and reduces it by a
factor of <i>N</i>, producing a PBM image as output.

<p><b>pbmreduce</b> duplicates a lot of the functionality of
<b>pamditherbw</b>; you could do something like <tt>pamscale |
pamditherbw</tt>, but <b>pbmreduce</b> is a lot faster.

<p>You can use <b>pbmreduce</b> to "re-halftone" an image.
Let's say you have a scanner that only produces black&amp;white, not
grayscale, and it does a terrible job of halftoning (most b&amp;w
scanners fit this description).  One way to fix the halftoning is to
scan at the highest possible resolution, say 300 dpi, and then reduce
by a factor of three or so using <b>pbmreduce</b>.  You can even
correct the brightness of an image, by using the <b>-value</b> option.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>pbmreduce</b> recognizes the following
command line options:

<dl>

<dt><b>-threshold</b>
<dd>
By default, <b>pbmreduce</b> does the halftoning after the reduction via
boustrophedonic Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion; however, you can use this
option to specify simple thresholding.  This gives better results when
reducing line drawings.

<dt><b>-value</b>
<dd>
<p>This option alters the thresholding value for all quantizations.  It should
be a real number between 0 and 1.  Above 0.5 means darker images; below 0.5
means lighter.

<dt><b>-randomseed=</b><i>integer</i>

<dd>This is the seed for the random number generator that controls the
halftoning.

<p>Use this to ensure you get the same image on separate invocations.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.75 (June 2016).
