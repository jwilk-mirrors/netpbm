<h2>NAME</h2>
ppmflash - brighten a picture to approach white

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

ppmflash 
<i>flashfactor</i>
[<i>ppmfile</i>]

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>ppmflash</b> reads a PPM image as input.  It changes the color of
each pixel to bring it a specified amount closer to white.  It
generates a PPM image of the result.

<p><i>flashfactor</i> is a real number between 0 and 1, inclusive.
<b>ppmflash</b> increases the intensity of each RGB component by the
fraction <i>flashfactor</i> of the difference between the current
value and full intensity.  So if a pixel contains 60% full red, 10%
full green, and no blue and you specify 0.5 (half), <b>ppmflash</b>
increases the red to 80% (because it was 40% from full intensity, so
it adds half of 40% to the original 60%), the green to 55%, and the
blue to 50%.

<p>If <i>flashfactor</i> is zero, the output is identical to the input.
If <i>flashfactor</i> is one, the output is all white.

<p><b>pambrighten</b> does a more normal kind of brightening.
<b>pamfunc</b> does a very simple brightening.  Both
<b>pambrighten</b> and <b>pamfunc</b> can reduce brightness as well.

<p><b>pnmgamma</b> is another way people do a similar brightening, though
it isn't really intended for that.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>There are no command line options defined specifically
for <b>ppmflash</b>, but it recognizes the options common to all
programs based on libnetpbm (See <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>.)
