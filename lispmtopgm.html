<h2>NAME</h2>
lispmtopgm - convert a Lisp Machine bitmap file to PGM

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>lispmtopgm</b>
[<i>lispmfile</i>]

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>listpmfile</b> reads a Lisp Machine bitmap as input and
produces a PGM image as output.

<p>This is the file format written by the tv:write-bit-array-file
function on TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.

<p>Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the Lispm image
file format does not include a color map, so we must treat it as a
monochrome instead and produce PGM.  This is unfortunate.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>There are no command line options defined specifically
for <b>lispmtopgm</b>, but it recognizes the options common to all
programs based on libnetpbm (See <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>.)

<h2 id="limitations">LIMITATIONS</h2>

The Lispm bitmap file format is a bit quirky;  Usually the image in the file
has its width rounded up to the next higher multiple of 32, but not always.
If the width is not a multiple of 32, we don't deal with it properly, but 
because of the Lispm microcode, such arrays are probably not image data 
anyway.

<p>Also, the Lispm code for saving bitmaps has a bug, in that if you
are writing a bitmap which is not mod32 across, the file may be up to
7 bits too short!  They round down instead of up, and we don't handle
this bug gracefully.
