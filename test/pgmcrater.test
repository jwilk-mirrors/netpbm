# This test is sensitive to differences in floating point math.
# With GCC slight results start to appear with -number 75 in
# the following test.  Compiler type (GCC, Clang, etc.),
# SSE math (by default off with x86 32 bit on with x86 64 bit)
# and --ffast-math are factors.

# We hope that by keeping the number of craters small the
# difference will not show up.
#
# The slight differences in the image file are not discernable by
# the naked eye.
