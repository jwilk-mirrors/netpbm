<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamtosvg</b> reads a PNM image as input and produce an SVG
(Scalable Vector Graphics) image as output.  Thus, it traces curves
in the input image and creates a set of splines that represent the
image.

<p>SVG is a vector image format, which means it describes curves that
compose an image.  By contrast, PNM is a raster format, which means it
describes dots that compose an image.  The main practical difference
between the two types is that you can scale vector images better.  A
vector image also takes a lot less data to describe an image if the
image is composed of simple curves.

<p>That means it is really an understatement to say that <b>pamtosvg</b>
is an image format converter.  It's really an image tracer.  Its main job
is to trace a raster image and find the lines in it.  It then represents
its findings in SVG format.

<p><b>pamtosvg</b> does the same kind of thing that StreamLine,
CorelTrace, and Autotrace do.  It is in fact derived from Autotrace.

<p>SVG is a gigantic format, capable of amazing things.  <b>pamtosvg</b>
exploits only a morsel of it.  The SVG image produced by <b>pamtosvg</b>
consists of a single &lt;svg&gt; element, which has a "width"
attribute and a "height" attribute.  The value of that element
is composed of &lt;path&gt; elements.  That's it.

<p>In the SVG output, distances are unitless, with one unit corresponding
to one pixel of the input.

<p>So that <b>pamtosvg</b> will find simple curves in the image, you
may want to remove speckles from it with <b>pbmclean</b> and consolidate
multiple shades into single colors with <b>pnmquant</b> first.

<p>For more information on SVG, see <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">the Worldwide Web Consortium's
SVG web page</a>.


<H2 id="options">OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<dt><b>-background-color=</b><i>colorname</i>

<dd>Treat the specified color as the background color and ignore it.

<p>If you don't specify this option, <b>pamtosvg</b> does not recognize
any background color.

<P>Specify the color (<i>colorname</i>) as described for the <a
href="libppm.html#colorname">argument of the <b>ppm_parsecolor()</b>
library routine</a>.

<dt><b>-centerline</b>

<dd>Trace an object's centerline.

<p>By default, <b>pamtosvg</b> traces an object's outline.

<dt><b>-corner-always-threshold=</b><i>angle</i>

<dd>Consider any angle at a pixel which falls below angle <i>angle</i>
(in decimal floating point degrees) as a corner, even if it is
bordered by other corner pixels.  Default is 60 degrees.

<dt><b>-corner-surround=</b><i>integer</i>

<dd>Consider the specified number of pixels on either side of a
point when determining if that point is a corner.  Default is 4.

<dt><b>-corner-threshold=</b><i>angle</i>

<dd>Consider any pixel which forms an angle with its predecessors and
successors that is smaller than <i>angle</i> (in decimal floating
point degrees) as a corner.  Default is 100.

<dt><b>-error-threshold=</b><i>float</i>

<dd>Subdivide fitted curves that are offset by a number of pixels
exceeding the specified number.  Default is 2.0.

<dt><b>-filter-iterations=</b><i>integer</i>

<dd>Smooth the curve the specified number of times prior to fitting
Default is 4.

<dt><b>-line-reversion-threshold=</b><i>float</i>

<dd>When a spline is closer to a straight line than the specified real
number weighted by the square of the curve length, maintain it as a
straight line, even if it is a list with curves.

<p>Default is .01.

<dt><b>-line-threshold=</b><i>float</i>

<dd>If a spline does not deviate from the straight line defined by its
endpoints by more than the specified number of pixels, then treat it
as a straight line.

<p>Default is 1.

<dt><b>-log</b>

<dd>Create a log of the curve tracing process (suitable for
debugging).  Put it in the file named <i>inputfile</i><b>.log</b> in
the current directory, where <i>inputfile</i> is the root of the input
file name, or "pamtosvg" if the input is from Standard Input
or a file with a weird name.

<dt><b>-preserve-width</b>

<dd>Preserve line width prior to thinning.  Meaningful only with
<b>-centerline</b>.

<dt><b>remove-adjacent-corners</b>

<dd>Remove adjacent corners.

<dt><b>-report-progress</b>

<dd>Report the progress of the tracing to Standard Error as it happens.

<dt><b>-tangent-surround</b>

<dd>Consider the specified number of points to either side of a point
when computing the tangent at that point.  Default is 3.

<dt><b>-width-weight-factor</b>

<dd>Weight factor for fitting the linewidth.

<H2 id="applicationnotes">Application Notes</H2>

<p>A convenient way to view an SVG document is with a web browser.  Many
understand a file whose name ends in ".svg" to be an SVG
image and can render it.

<h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>

<p><b>pamtosvg</b> was added to Netpbm in Version 10.33 (March 2006).

<p>The core of <b>pamtosvg</b> -- the curve tracing logic -- was taken
nearly unmodified from Martin Weber's Autotrace program.  That program
duplicates a lot of Netpbm function, so <b>pamtosvg</b> is a much leaner
program.

<p>Bryan Henderson created <b>pamtosvg</b>, basically just by adapting
Autotrace to Netpbm.

<p>Autotrace was first released in 2000 and updates were released
through 2002.  A number of people wrote the code in it, but Masatake
Yamato and Martin Weber appear to be the principal creators of it.

<p>As of June 2006, there was a <a
href="http://autotrace.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge project</a> for it.
