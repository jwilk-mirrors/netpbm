<h2>NAME</h2>

pnmarith - replaced by pamarith

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p>Starting with Netpbm 10.3, <b>pnmarith</b> is obsolete.  Use
<a href="pamarith.html"><b>pamarith</b></a> instead.

<b>pamarith</b> is backward compatible with <b>pnmarith</b> except where
your input images have different depths.  <b>pnmarith</b> would convert
the one with the lesser depth to have the higher depth before doing the
arithmetic.  With <b>pamarith</b>, you must do that step separately, using
<b>pgmtoppm</b>.
