<B>pnmcomp</B> - replaced by pamcomp


<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pnmcomp</b> was obsoleted by <a href="pamcomp.html"><b>pamcomp</b></a>,
introduced with Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004).  <b>pamcomp</b> is backward
compatible with <b>pnmcomp</b>, plus adds many additional functions.  Among
this is the ability to process PAM images, including those with transparency
channels.

<p><b>pnmcomp</b> remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.68 (September
2014) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than <b>pamcomp</b> because of
its age.  But now it would just be clutter.

<p>In Netpbm before 10.21, use the manual for <b>pamcomp</b> with
<b>pnmcomp</b>.  Features that are in <b>pamcomp</b> but not <b>pnmcomp</b>
are indicated by statements that they didn't exist before 10.21.
