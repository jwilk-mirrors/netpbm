<h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>

<p>A program of this name was written in 1993 by Ingo Wilken and was
part of Netpbm until Release 10.34 (April 2006).  At that time, it was
replaced in Netpbm by the current program, which was written by Bryan
Henderson.  The function of the newer program is identical to that of
the older one; the reason for the replacement is that the newer one is
easier to maintain.
