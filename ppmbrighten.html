<h1>ppmbrighten</h1>
Updated: 09 August 2020

<h2>NAME</h2>

ppmbrighten - replaced by pambrighten

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p>Starting with Netpbm 10.86 (March 2019), <b>ppmbrighten</b> is
obsolete.  Use <a href="pambrighten.html"><b>pambrighten</b></a> instead.

<b>pambrighten</b> is mostly backward compatible with <b>ppmbrighten</b>.  You
can use the <b>pambrighten</b> manual for <b>ppmbrighten</b> as long as you
ignore features that were added after Netpbm 10.86.

<p>One way in which <b>pambrighten</b> is not backward compatible is that
  <b>pambrighten</b> does not have a <b>-normalize</b> option.  If you want
  that function, use <b>pnmnorm</b> on the image before passing it to
  <b>pambrighten</b>.

<p>Another backward incompatibility is that <b>pambrighten</b> produces the
  same kind of output as the input, whereas <b>ppmbrighten</b> always
  produces PPM.  If you need PPM output, pass the results through
  <b>ppmtoppm</b>.

<p><b>ppmbrighten</b> is currently implemented as a triviel program that
  invokes <b>pambrighten</b>, <b>pnmnorm</b>, and <b>ppmtoppm</b>.
