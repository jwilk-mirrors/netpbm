<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pgmhist</b> reads a PGM image as input and prints a histogram of the
gray values or other gray value distribution metrics.


<p>If you specify none of <b>-median</b>, <b>-quartile</b>, or <b>-decile</b>,
<b>pgmhist</b> prints a complete histogram showing how many pixels of each
possible gray value exist in the image.  Along with each gray value, it tells
you how many pixels are more black and more white that it.

<p><b>-median</b>, <b>-quartile</b>, and <b>-decile</b> options cause
<b>pgmhist</b> instead to print the indicated quantiles.  Each quantile is a
gray value that actually appears in the image (as opposed to fractional values
that are sometimes used for quantiles).  The 3rd quartile is the least gray
value for which at least 75% of the pixels are as dark or darker than it.
The 4th quartile is the brightest gray value that appears in the image.


<H2 id="options">OPTIONS</H2>

You must specify exactly one of the ramp type options.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-median</B>
<DD>

<P>This option causes <b>pgmhist</b> to print the median gray value.

<p>You may specify at most one of <b>-median</b>, <b>-quartile</b>, and
<b>-decile</b>.

<P>This option was new in Neptbm 10.61 (December 2012).

<DT><B>-quartile</B>
<DD>

<P>This option causes <b>pgmhist</b> to print the four quartile gray value.

<p>You may specify at most one of <b>-median</b>, <b>-quartile</b>, and
<b>-decile</b>.

<P>This option was new in Neptbm 10.61 (December 2012).

<DT><B>-decile</B>
<DD>
     
<P>This option causes <b>pgmhist</b> to print the ten decile gray value.

<p>You may specify at most one of <b>-median</b>, <b>-quartile</b>, and
<b>-decile</b>.

<P>This option was new in Neptbm 10.61 (December 2012).

<DT><B>-machine</B>
<DD>

<p>This option causes <b>pgmhist</b> to print the information in a way
easily digestible by a machine as opposed to a human.

<p>For the quantiles, there is one line per quantile, in quantile order, and
it consists of the gray value of the quantile in decimal with no leading
zeroes.

<p>For the full histogram output, it consists of one line per possible
gray value (whether that value appears in the image or not), in order of
the gray values.  The line consists of two tokens separated by a space.  The
first is the gray value; the second is the number of pixels in the image that
have that gray value.  Both are decimal numbers without leading zeroes.

<P>This option was new in Neptbm 10.61 (December 2012).
