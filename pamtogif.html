may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may
use either white space or an equals sign between an option name and its
value.

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamtogif</b> reads a Netpbm image as input and produces a GIF file
as output.

<p>This program creates only individual GIF images.  To combine
multiple GIF images into an animated GIF, use <a
href="http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/"><b>gifsicle</b></a> (not part of
the Netpbm package).

<p><b>pamtogif</b> creates either an original GIF87 format GIF file or
the newer GIF89 format.  It creates GIF89 when you request features
that were new with GIF89, to wit the <b>-transparent</b> or
<b>-comment</b> options.  Otherwise, it creates GIF87.  Really old GIF
readers conceivably could not recognize GIF89.

<p>The GIF format is not capable of representing an image with more than
256 colors in it (it contains a color map with a maximum size of 256).
If the image you want to convert has more colors than that (<b>ppmhist</b>
can tell you), you can use <b>pnmquant</b> to reduce it to 256.  Or
use the more complex but faster method described under the <b>-mapfile</b>
option.

<p>If your input image is a PAM with transparency information, <b>ppmtogif</b>
uses one entry in the GIF colormap specifically for the transparent pixels,
so you can have at most 255 opaque colors.  In contrast, if you use the
<b>-transparent</b> option, one of the colors from the input becomes
transparent, so the limit is still 256.

<p><b>pamtogif</b> was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006).  In older Netpbm,
use <b>ppmtogif</b>.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>pamtogif</b> recognizes the following
command line options:

<dl compact>

<dt><b>-interlace</b>

<dd>
Produce an interlaced GIF file.

<dt><b>-sort</b>

<dd>
Produce a GIF file with a color map sorted in a predictable order.

<p>This does <em>not</em> produce the sorted color map which is part
of the GIF format.  That kind of sorted color map is one where the
colors are sorted according to how important they are, and the GIF
header tells the viewer that it is sorted that way.  Its purpose is to
allow the viewer to use fewer colors than are in the color map if it
is not capable of displaying all the colors.

<p>What this option produces is a color map sorted by red value, then
green, then blue.  That can be useful in analyzing GIF images, particularly
those made with two versions of the program, because it removes some of
the variability.


<dt><b>-mapfile=</b><i>mapfile</i>

<dd>

<p>Use the colors found in the file <i>mapfile</i> to create the
colormap in the GIF file, instead of the colors from <i>netpbmfile</i>.
<i>mapfile</i> can be any PPM file; all that matters is the colors in
it.  If the colors in <i>netpbmfile</i> do not match those in
<i>mapfile</i>, <b>pamtogif</b> matches them to a "best
match." You can obtain a much better result by using <b>pnmremap</b>
to change the colors in the input to those in the map file.

<p>The <i>mapfile</i> file is not a palette file, just an image whose
colors you want to use.  The order of colors in the GIF palette have
nothing to do with where they appear in the <i>mapfile</i> image, and
duplication of colors in the image is irrelevant.

<p>The map file's depth must match the number of color components in
the input (which is not necessarily the same as the input's depth --
the input might have a transparency plane in addition).  If your map file
does not, or it <em>might</em> not, run your input through
<b>pnmremap</b> using the same map file so that it does.

<p>You can use <b>-mapfile</b> to speed up conversion of an image where you
already have a map file because of earlier processing of your image.  For
example, it is common to start with an image that has more than 256 colors
and remap its colors to a set of 256 colors so that <b>pamgtogif</b> can
convert it (a GIF can have only 256 colors; <b>pamtogif</b> without
<b>-mapfile</b> fails on any image that has more than that) with
<b>pnmquant</b>.  When you do this, <b>pnmquant</b> generates a palette to do
the color quantization, then <b>pamtogif</b> generates an identical palette
from the quantized image.  You can save computation by generating the palette
once:

<pre>
<kbd>
    $ pnmcolormap 256 myimage.ppm &gt;/tmp/colormap.ppm
    $ pamtogif myimage.ppm -mapfile=/tmp/colormap.ppm &gt;output.gif
</kbd>
</pre>


<dt><b>-transparent=</b><i>color</i>

<dd>
<b>pamtogif</b> marks the specified color as transparent in the GIF image.

<p>If you don't specify <b>-transparent</b>, <b>pamtogif</b> does not
mark any color transparent (except as indicated by the transparency
information in the input file).

<p>Specify the color (<i>color</i>) as described for the <a
href="libnetpbm_image.html#colorname">argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b>
library routine</a>.

<p>If the color you specify is not present in the image, <b>pamtogif</b>
selects instead the color in the image that is closest to the one you
specify.  Closeness is measured as a Cartesian distance between colors
in RGB space.  If multiple colors are equidistant, <b>pamtogif</b>
chooses one of them arbitrarily.

<p>However, if you prefix your color specification with "=",
e.g.  <b>-transparent==red</b>, only the exact color you specify will
be transparent.  If that color does not appear in the image, there
will be no transparency.  <b>pamtogif</b> issues an information
message when this is the case.

<p>When you specify <b>-transparent</b>, <b>pamtogif</b> ignores
explicit transparency information (the "alpha channel") in
the input image.

<dt><b>-alpha=</b><i>pgmfile</i>

<dd>There is no <b>-alpha</b> option.  <b>pamtogif</b>'s predecessor had
such an option because it was not capable of taking PAM input that contains
a transparency (alpha) plane, so one used this option to supply a
transparency plane as a separate PGM file.

 This option names a PGM file that contains a transparency mask for the
image.  <b>pamtogif</b> creates fully transparent pixels wherever the
transparency mask indicates transparency greater than 50%.  The color of
those pixels is that specified by the <b>-alphacolor</b>
option, or black by default.

<p>To do this, <b>pamtogif</b> creates an entry in the GIF colormap in
addition to the entries for colors that are actually in the image.  It
marks that colormap entry as transparent and uses that colormap index
in the output image to create a transparent pixel.

<p> The transparency image must be the same dimensions as the input
image, but may have any maxval.  White means opaque and black means
transparent.

<p> You cannot specify both <b>-transparent</b> and <b>-alpha</b>.  

<dt><b>-alphacolor=</b><i>color</i>

<dd>This specifies the foreground color for transparent pixels.  A
viewer may use the foreground color for a transparent pixel if it
chooses not to have another color "show through.".  The
default is black.

<p>This applies only to pixels that are transparent in the GIF because
they are transparent in the Netpbm input.  If a GIF pixel is
transparent because of the <b>-transparent</b> option, the foreground
color is the color indicated by that option.

<p>Note that in GIF, all transparent pixels have the same foreground
color.  (There is only one entry in the GIF colormap for transparent
pixels).

<p>Specify the color (<i>color</i>) as described for the <a
href="libnetpbm_image.html#colorname">argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b>
library routine</a>.

<dt><b>-comment=</b><i>text</i>

<dd>
Include a comment in the GIF output with comment text <i>text</i>.

<p>Without this option, there are no comments in the output.

<p>Note that in a command shell, you'll have to use quotation marks around
<i>text</i> if it contains characters (e.g. space) that would make the shell
think it is multiple arguments:
<pre>
$ pamtogif -comment "this is a comment" &lt;xxx.ppm &gt;xxx.gif
</pre>

<dt><b>-noclear</b>

<dd>
<p>This option causes the output not to contain any GIF clear codes.

<p>In GIF, the stream defines codes that represent strings of pixels as it
goes.  The stream contains definitions of codes mixed in with the references
to those codes that describe the pixels of the image.  GIF specifies a maximum
number of codes that can be defined; when the stream has defined that many,
the stream can either just use those for the rest of the image or include a
clear code, deleting all the string codes so that the stream can start over
defining new ones.

<p>By far the most common choice is the clear code.  This usually results in a
smaller stream because the set of strings of pixels that occur in an image
vary over the parts of the image.  Hardly any GIF encoders produce streams
that don't use the clear code.

<p>But it is conceivable that a stream could be smaller without the use of the
clear code because it saves the stream having to redefine the same string
codes over and over.  It could even avoid a thrashing situation where the
stream continually defines a set of strings that never get used again before
the maximum is reached.

<p>The default is to use the clear codes.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.82 (March 2018).  Before that, the program
aways uses the clear codes.
    
<dt><b>-nolzw</b>

<dd>
<p>This option is mainly of historical interest -- it involves use of
a patent that is now expired.

<p>This option causes the GIF output, and thus <b>pamtogif</b>, not to
use LZW (Lempel-Ziv) compression.  As a result, the image file is
larger and, before the patent expired, no royalties would be owed to
the holder of the patent on LZW.  See the section LICENSE below.

<p>LZW is a method for combining the information from multiple pixels into a
single GIF code.  With the <b>-nolzw</b> option, <b>pamtogif</b>
creates one GIF code per pixel, so it is not doing any compression and not
using LZW.  However, any GIF decoder, whether it uses an LZW decompressor
or not, will correctly decode this uncompressed format.  An LZW decompressor
would see this as a particular case of LZW compression.

<p>Note that if someone uses an LZW decompressor such as the one in
<b>giftopnm</b> or pretty much any graphics display program to process
the output of <b>pamtogif -nolzw </b>, he is then using the LZW
patent.  But the patent holder expressed far less interest in
enforcing the patent on decoding than on encoding.

<dt><b>-aspect=</b><i>fraction</i>

<dd>This is the aspect ratio of the pixels of the image.  Its only
effect is to record that information in the GIF for use by whatever
interprets the GIF.  Note that this feature of GIF is hardly ever used
and most GIF decoders ignore this information and assume pixels are
square.

<p>Pixels in a Netpbm image do not have aspect ratios; there is always
a one-one correspondence between GIF pixels and Netpbm pixels.

<p>The aspect ratio is the quotient of width divided by height.  GIF
allows aspect ratios from 0.25 (1:4) to 4 (4:1) in increments of 1/64.
<b>pamtogif</b> implements a natural extension of GIF that allows an
aspect ratio up to 4 14/64.  If you specify anything outside this range,
<b>pamtogif</b> fails.  <b>pamtogif</b> rounds <i>fraction</i> to
the nearest 1/64.

<p>The default is square (1.0).

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007).  Before that, the
pixels are always square.


<dt><b>-verbose</b>

<dd>This option causes <b>pamtogif</b> to display information about the
conversion process and the image it produces.

<h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>

<p><b>pamtogif</b> was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006).  It
replaced <b>ppmtogif</b>, which created GIF images for Pbmplus/Netpbm
users since 1989.

<p>The main outward change in the conversion from <b>ppmtogif</b> to
<b>pamtogif</b> was that <b>pamtogif</b> was able to use transparency
information ("alpha channel") in PAM input, whereas with
<b>ppmtogif</b>, one had to supply the transparency mask in a separate
pseudo-PGM image (via the <b>-alpha</b> option).

<p>Jef Poskanzer wrote <b>ppmtogif</b> in 1989, and it has always been
a cornerstone of Pbmplus/Netpbm because GIF is such a popular image
format.  Jef based the LZW encoding on GIFENCOD by David Rowley &lt;<a
href="mailto:mgardi@watdcsu.waterloo.edu">mgardi@watdcsu.waterloo.edu</a>&gt;.
Jef included GIFENCOD's GIFCOMPR.C file pretty much whole.  Rowley, in
turn, adapted the LZW compression code from classic Unix
<b>compress</b>, which used techniques described in IEEE Computer,
June 1984.

<p>Jef's <b>ppmtogif</b> notably lacked the ability to use a
transparency mask with it.  You could create transparent pixels in a
GIF, but only with the <b>-transparent</b> option, which allowed one
to specify that all pixels of a certain color in the input were to be
transparent.  Bryan Henderson added the <b>-alpha</b> option in July
2001 so you could supply a mask image that indicates exactly which
pixels are to be transparent, and those pixels could have the same
color as other opaque ones.

<p>Bryan Henderson added another significant piece of code and
function in October 2001: the ability to generate a GIF without using
the LZW patent -- an uncompressed GIF.  This was very important to
many people at the time because the GIF patent was still in force, and
this allowed them to make an image that any GIF viewer could display,
royalty-free.  Bryan adapted code from the Independent JPEG Group's
<b>djpeg</b> for that.

<p>There is no code in <b>pamtogif</b> from Jef's original, but Jef
may still hold copyright over it because of the way in which it evolved.
Virtually all of the code in <b>pamtogif</b> was written by Bryan
Henderson and contributed to the public domain.


<h2 id="license">LICENSE</h2>

<p>If you use <b>pamtogif</b> without the <b>-nolzw</b> option, you
are using a patent on the LZW compression method which is owned by
Unisys.  The patent has expired (in 2003 in the US and in 2004
elsewhere), so it doesn't matter.  While the patent was in force, most
people who used <b>pamtogif</b> and similar programs did so without a
license from Unisys to do so.  Unisys typically asked $5000 for a
license for trivial use of the patent.  Unisys never enforced the
patent against trivial users.

<p>Rumor has it that IBM also owns or owned a patent covering
<b>pamtogif</b>.

<p>A replacement for the GIF format that never required any patents to
use is the PNG format.
