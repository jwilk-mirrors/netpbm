Files in this directory are for creating a Debian package (.deb file),
which one can use to install Netpbm on a Debian system (or a system running
a derivative of Debian, such as Ubuntu or Mint).

You can of course install on one of these systems by running 'installnetpbm',
or otherwise inserting all the files in the proper place in your system file
tree, but having a Debian package allows you to manage those files using
Debian's normal package management.  The package management system will know
where the Netpbm files came from, and you can upgrade or remove Netpbm easily.
The package management system will also be aware of prerequisites of Netpbm
and ensure that you don't have Debian's own inferior version of Netpbm
installed (which would cause conflicts).

The package we create is named 'netpbm-sf' (where the "sf" is from
"SourceForge"), to be distinct from the package named "netpbm" which is part
of Debian.

To install Netpbm as a Debian package:

  1) Follow the regular instructions to build and package Netpbm
     (configure, make, make package).

  2) $ BUILDTOOLS=netpbm-src/buildtools

     (netpbm-src is a Netpbm source tree).

  3) $ $BUILDTOOLS/debian/mkdeb -buildtools=$BUILDTOOLS

     (This defaults to getting Netpbm from /tmp/netpbm, which is also where
     'make package' defaults to putting it).

  4) $ dpkg --install netpbm-sfXXXX.deb

     (netpbm-sfXXXX.deb is the file created by 'makedeb', in the current
     directory).
