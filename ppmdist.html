<h2>NAME</h2>

ppmdist - simplistic grayscale assignment for machine generated, color images

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>ppmdist</b>

[<b>-intensity</b>|<b>-frequency</b>]

[<i>ppmfile</i>]

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>ppmdist</b> reads a PPM image as input and performs a simplistic
grayscale assignment intended for use with grayscale or bitmap
printers.

<p>Often conversion from ppm to pgm will yield an image with contrast
too low for good printer output.  The program maximizes contrast
between the gray levels output.

<p>A ppm input of n colors is read, and a pgm of n gray levels is
written.  The gray levels take on the values 0..n-1, while maxval
takes on n-1.

<p>The mapping from color to stepped grayscale can be performed in
order of input pixel intensity, or input pixel frequency (number of
repetitions).

<p>This program is helpful only for images with a very small number of
colors.


<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>ppmdist</b> recognizes the following
command line options:

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-frequency</b>

<dd>Sort input colors by the number of times a color appears in the
input, before mapping to evenly distributed graylevels of output.

<dt><b>-intensity</b>

<dd>Sort input colors by their grayscale intensity, before mapping to
evenly distributed graylevels of output.  This is the default.
