<h2>NAME</h2>

psidtopgm - convert PostScript "image" data to a PGM image

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>psidtopgm</b> <i>width</i> <i>height</i> <i>bits/sample</i> [<i>imagedata</i>]

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>psidtopgm</b> reads the "image" data from a PostScript
file as input and produces a PGM image as output.

<p>This program is obsoleted by <b>pstopnm</b>.

What follows was written before <b>pstopnm </b> existed.

<p>This is a very simple and limited program, and is here only because
so many people have asked for it.  To use it you have to
<em>manually</em> extract the readhexstring data portion from your
PostScript file, and then give the width, height, and bits/sample on
the command line.  Before you attempt this, you should <em>at
least</em> read the description of the "image" operator in
the PostScript Language Reference Manual.

<p>It would probably not be too hard to write a script that uses this
filter to read a specific variety of PostScript image, but the
variation is too great to make a general-purpose reader.  Unless, of
course, you want to write a full-fledged PostScript interpreter...

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>There are no command line options defined specifically
for <b>psidtopgm</b>, but it recognizes the options common to all
programs based on libnetpbm (See <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>.)
