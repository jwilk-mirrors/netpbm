ppmdcfont - Turn a Ppmdfont file into C source for a builtin font

<H2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>ppmdcfont</B>


<H2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p>(There are no arguments or options)

<p><b>ppmdcfont</b> creates a C source file that you can compile into
a built-in font for use with the Netpbm PPM drawing facilities.  It
reads a Ppmdfont file on Standard Input and writes the C source code to
Standard Output.

<p>The output C source code has the font object's name hardcoded as
<b>ppmd_standardfont</b>, which you will definitely want to edit,
because that is the name of the font built in to <b>libnetpbm</b>.  If
you don't change it, it will conflict both cognitively and in program
linking.  There should obviously be an option on <b>ppmdcfont</b> to
choose this, but the development effort has not been justified so far.

<p>See <A HREF="libnetpbm_draw.html">Libnetpbm PPM Drawing Function
Manual</A> for details on Ppmdfont files.
