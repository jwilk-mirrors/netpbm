pnmdepth - change the maxval in a PNM image

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<P>Starting with Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), <b>pnmdepth</b> is
obsolete.  Use <a href="pamdepth.html"><b>pamdepth</b></a> instead.

<b>pamdepth</b> is backward compatible with <b>pnmdepth</b>.  You can
use the <b>pamdepth</b> manual for <b>pnmdepth</b> as long as you ignore
features that were added after Netpbm 10.31.

<p>For backward compatibility, the name 'pnmdepth' continues to exist
as an alias for 'pamdepth'.  But because of a bug, that name doesn't work
in Netpbm 10.32.  You have to fix the symbolic link.
